    <strong>Monitored Memory.</strong>

</p>
<p>
    That morning, a young man entered a seemingly vacant office. He flipped on the light switch, filling the room with the tormenting hue of fluorescent lights
    that reminded him of a prison yard. He proceeded to fiddle with banks of switches and arrays of buttons that were embedded in a dented sheetrock wall.
    Every button light and switch was arranged like the little soldiers that marched across the square on Sunday. Next he situated himself in an old wobbly
spinning chair. He finally reached for a keyboard punching a series of keys with intense <a>conviction</a>    <a id="_anchor_1" href="#_msocom_1" name="_msoanchor_1">[W1]</a> . Mounted on a panoramic steel frame a range of monitors came to life. The man's ears
    winced at the whine of the high voltage passing through the convex cluster of CRT monitors. Spinning around in the chair the man saw monitors from floor to
    ceiling all around him. The man typed in his username and password. All his monitors began to transition from pointless static to CCTV video feeds from all
    around the city. In the background, a spotty speaker howled the man’s name, “Welcome Jonathan”. Before looking up at the first camera, Jonathan affixed his
    hand to mouse that rested on the arm of his chair.
</p>
<p>
Jonathan had situated himself like this everyday for the past two years.<em>I had forgotten color; all I knew was the black and white of the monitors.</em><sup>ii</sup><em> </em>The room was always warm    <em>But I always felt cold. </em>Jonathan, an innocent citizen, <a>is </a><a id="_anchor_2" href="#_msocom_2" name="_msoanchor_2">[W2]</a> at the helm of a
    surveillance dynasty purpose built to monitor the actions of people from every corner of the country. More importantly, it was Jonathan’s job to entirely
    sequester a person’s life with the delicate click of his chair-mounted mouse. His mouse wielded the power to have a person completely wiped off the city
streets. Because privacy was non-existent; no one could avoid being dispatched<sup>i</sup>.    <a>Even the slightest violation or government opposition would have a person sent away</a><a id="_anchor_3" href="#_msocom_3" name="_msoanchor_3">[W3]</a>
    . Every minute of every day Jonathan spent finding people who were opposing the great leader and his government. His mouse was like the trigger of a gun,
    the shooter blind to what might happen when it strikes a <a>transgressor</a><a id="_anchor_4" href="#_msocom_4" name="_msoanchor_4">[W4]</a> . However
    Jonathan’s pervasive grasp on peoples privacy weren’t out of madness or revenge. <em>All I had to do was focus, just focus on the monitors. </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em> </em>
    Nevertheless he never had to worry about his assets being frozen, family detained, fired from work or quarters searched. Jonathan had never felt this utter
robbery of his basic personal freedoms.<em> It was a click <a>and …. zip </a></em><a id="_anchor_5" href="#_msocom_5" name="_msoanchor_5">[W5]</a>    <em>never seen again. I fear to think about it anymore? </em>All he knew was that he would never see that person face again on his screens.
</p>
<p>
    Jonathan’s eyes were drawn to a screen like a magnet; he could see the outlines of two nebulous figures, fumbling with goods at a store. Jonathan proceed
    to focus all his attention on the one monitor looking at it like the sight of rifle, ready to obliterate its target. He panned the camera around the store,
    like a vulture looking for food, noticing the figures trading contraband and censored material by depositing the goods deep into each other’s jacket. Like
    clockwork Jonathan clicked his mouse, <strong>click</strong><sup>iii</sup><em>. </em>His click was like an obituary sent at the speed of light. Traveling
    through the twist and turns of the telecommunications networks that were the sad messengers of death. The notice arrived instantaneously at the police
    station, which directed the officers to detain the two violators. Unknowingly, Jonathan’s click was the knife that drew the blood of the two men until they
    had no more emotion and memory. The only thing Jonathan saw was the two figures being removed from the establishment, yet their lifeless eyes and face
    stood out to him. Jonathan was like an automaton, his actions mechanical but like a human his memory remained extremely malleable. Memory to Jonathan was
    priceless because he never had the opportunity to see the world in a state of intense fervor. Every dispatch Jonathan triggered, he witnessed the last
moment, last face, and the last emotions of people before being sent away. To Jonathan    <em>every time I click that mouse I feel like there’s a hole burning in my displays, my eyes and worst my memory</em> <em>Ahhh…just another day. </em>
</p>
<p>
    Every day, each click became coupled with more transformative memories and emotions. Jonathan went from seeing the black and white of the displays, to the
rich color of the now trampled dreams buried in people who were caught on the displays.    <em>It was like I was in a trance but the screens never changed.</em> All his memories came together, creating a world of Technicolor within Jonathan’s
    mind and memory. His memories of those he monitored had leached into his own memories overwriting anything that happened to Jonathan in the past. Jonathan
    kept wondering about why he would have been taken by the police, it seemed forever ago. Jonathan’s seething pain of his memory overwritten plagued him; it
    was like a needle being pushed deep around his skull.
</p>
<p>
    Jonathan kept asking himself, <em>I have never disobeyed anyone, why is my mind… tormenting me. </em>He couldn’t understand why his mind was spinning in
    chaotic circles. Jonathan’s state of disarray was poisonous. He began to sporadically dispatch people for no reason. Yet he paused once to mull over his
    corrupted memory. He had deeply immersed himself in his memory of being captured. He remembers dropping the banned book to accept the death grip of the
    cuffs. He was then chained to a wall; the chain like a spring, every time he tried to resist he snapped back into reality coming closer to pain and
    suffering. <em>But what happened next, What?</em> Jonathan had to figure out what happened next he would have to experience being dispatched in reality. It
would answer his biggest question, in turn dampening his horrendous memories and tormenting dreams.    <em>I am the monitor, but how can I be dispatched? </em>
</p>
<p>
    He leaped out of his chair, gravitating towards the banks of switches and buttons he used early in the morning. He was slowly traveling towards his end.
    Jonathan perspired more and more after each switch he toggled and button he pressed. The monitors began to fade slowly then light up as electricity surged
    unregulated through them. Then he flipped another switched that terminated the video feed for each camera. The millions of cameras all around the country
    began to vibrate violently as their internals were fried to a crisp. Jonathan began to fill with feelings of pride and liberation. Scared he looked back at
    the cluster of monitors shielding his eyes as the exploded, spraying shards of razor sharp lead and poison covered glass in all directions.
</p>
<p>
    Jonathan kneeled where he was. As he thought hard and long about his decision he heard the blaring radio from outside the office.
    <em>
        The governmental surveillance program suffered a technical blow rendering the system unusable. As a result, universal surveillance will terminate and
        freedom finally yours!
    </em>
    Jonathan paused to hear the roars and shouts from the square below the office. Suddenly the sounds of joy and thanksgiving were silenced by the sound of
    hard boots and rifles walking up the stairwell. <em>I couldn’t remember how this started but their, finally here! </em>As the office door opened, the light
    that emanated from the hallway blinded Jonathan. Jonathan could see the silhouette of the secret police as the moved in front of the light. Their hands at
    their sides like hyenas staring down at their prey. The officers took Jonathan out of the officed dragging him out of the building by the collar of his
    soiled shirt. He was dragged around the square like a dead dog, yet people were clapping and shouting for joy. Jonathan smiled knowing that his fellow
    citizens would live in anonymity and freedom forever. But all Jonathan wanted to do was to experience being dispatched in reality. As the police rounded
    the corner they entered the station speedily walking towards an unmarked room. They opened the door revealing a room, the walls stained with blood and
    covered in hair. Jonathan’s delicate body was blood-soaked after being dragged down stairs and across gravel that pulverized his skin. He was propelled
    toward the ground followed by a cold metal barrel pressed against his head. The room was filled with the painful noise of grinding metal within the trigger
assembly of the officer’s gun. Split seconds before the firing pin pierced the back of the bullet Jonathan screamed out with joy.    <em>Now I rememb… Bang.</em>
